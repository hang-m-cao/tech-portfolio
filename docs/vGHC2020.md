*This year, I was fortunate enough to receive the BRAID ICS Scholarship to attend the Grace Hopper Conference. So, first and foremost, I would like to thank the BRAID Initiative, the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, and WICS for giving me this opportunity.* 🥳

There were thousands of women from all over the world coming to the conference for different reasons, whether it was to look for an internship or career, network, or learn more about their field of interest. For me, it was to explore and see what a conference was like. I attended various sessions, workshops, and company booths. Although I did not get to network much or meet one-on-one with any recruiters, I still enjoyed my first Grace Hopper Conference. 

## Sessions
With hundreds of sessions and workshops overall, it was difficult to choose which to attend. In the end, I went for ones that piqued my interest, watching as many as I could with adequate breaks in between. Luckily, the on-demand content makes it easier to go back and watch the many sessions. Here are some of my highlights. Images are kept to a minimum to respect the presentation of the speakers.

🌐 **Code Your Technical Portfolio** *Jacqui Grindrod, Rachel Sharp, Rosemary Wang (HashiCorp)* 

First, I want to highlight this workshop hosted by HashiCorp that made this actual website possible! I don't have any experience with making my own website or portfolio, so when I saw this workshop, I knew I had to attend. I remember logging on to the Zoom link 45 minutes early just to make sure I secured my spot before spaces filled up. 

Even for me, the [template repository](https://github.com/joatmon08/tech-portfolio) made everything very easy! All I had to do was fork the repository and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file. I got the website up and running in less than 5 minutes. The instructions were simple enough that I could go ahead and update the website to have my information, such as my name, tagline, color preference, and social media links. This website was made using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/en/ "Docusaurus Documentation") and [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#blockquotes "Markdown Cheat Sheet").

🧚 **Streaming Infrastructure: Building Software Solutions & Delivering Content at the Edge** *Vidya Mane, Alima Wolfson (Disney)*

With this session, I got an inside look at the process of how Disney+ users can get the content on their devices. It starts with the user's request for specific content. That request would find its way to the origin server that contains all the Disney+ shows, and the origin server would respond to the client with the requested content. To facilitate the process and prevent overloading the origin server, there are content delivery networks (CDN) that stand between the user request and the origin server, and there are midteirs in between the CDN and the origin. Clients would connect to different CDN depending on their point of presence (PoP) determined by their location. Essentially, the midteirs and CDN tries to see if the content has already been requested. If it has, the content has already been pre-loaded, so there is no need to go to the origin server. If it has not, the request makes its way to the origin server to load it.

🗺️ **Developing Live View for Google Maps: A Lesson in Working With Emerging Technologies** *Rachel Inman, Wenli Zhao (Google)*

Google has recently added a great new feature to Maps to help people find their ways. When exploring new places, it can be difficult to pinpoint which way to face or where to looking for the next turn. This is especially true in urban cities with bustling streets where you can easily get lost or swept away. Because of the many buildings, GPS location can be slightly off, which can make you end up in a different location. 

To make navigating easier, Google introduced Live View, using localization and AR to better pinpoint your location and visualize your path. Google Maps was able to use machine learning,  computer vision, and landmarks to detect where users were by comparing their surroundings to the Street View database. Then, with the use of ARCore, Google Maps provides users with arrows on where to go next.

Throughout the development process, Google ran into many problems, such as how they wanted the visuals to look and incorporating the prototype with the existing application. It took lots of testing with people to find which visuals worked best for users and to keep the application in sync across platforms. 

Overall, I enjoyed being at this session and seeing the challenges the design and engineering teams faced and how they overcame those problems to produce such an innovation feature.

👩‍💻 **Legacy of Women in Computing** *Sheila Tejada (Computing Savvy Research Group), Vidya Srinivasan (Microsoft)*

One of the most inspirations sessions I attended was this one, where I got to hear about the many talented women in technology that came before me. 


🧍 **Wearable Technology to the Rescue: Human-Computer Interaction via Oral Assistive-Devices** *Hananeh Esmailbeigi (HideIT Wearables LLC)*

With technology constantly developing, one of its greatest purposes is to help people in need, especially those with disabilities. There are head and gaze trackers to pinpoint where someone is looking on a virtual keyboard. There are voice recognition and predictive to help people better communicate.

Recently, there was the development of using a person's tongue to type. First, there was the user interface cursor-controller (U-UIC), a Bluetooth device people would wear over their teeth. The device would connect to a cursor on a screen, and users would move their tongue around to move the cursor and type out words. However, this technology resulted in taking more time to type out phrases. After came the oral-user interface controller (O-UIC) that implemented the phone keypad with eight contact pads. 

In comparison to existing technology like the gaze tracker or a mouth sticker, the O-UIC was pretty average, and in comparison to voice recognition, it still had a long way to go. However, of the users surveyed, a majority of them believed the Tongue Trackpad would help in their daily lives.

💪 **To Succeed Faster, Get Comfortable With Risk** *Aimee Cardwell (Optum Financial Services)* 


💼 **Cracking the Internship Code** *Mariana Briones, Alejandro Davila (InternMakers)* 

As a way of helping college students start their technical careers, Mariana and Alejandro held a workshop and gave advices on how to get an internship. They provided a starting point for undergraduates on their internship search, with a complied list of freshman/sophomore programs and of software companies and startups. Mariana and Alejandro showed us how to keep track of recruitment season with a simple framework. 

![Internship Framework](./assets/session-internship-framework.png)

The speakers also walked us through crafting an elevator pitch and even gave one on the spot as an example! They introduced us to the STAR method used for interviewing in addition to tips and tricks on preparing for technical and behavioral interviews. What I found most helpful was their framework for researching companies, their location, products, and mission or vision. I found that doing so makes it easier to see whether or not I want to work at a specific company, and it also prepares me for a career fair or interview. 

All the resources provided were compiled into this helpful [guide](http://bit.ly/internship-resources-handout "A Crash Course on How to Get an Internship in Tech")!

## Words of Wisdom
Throughout the conference, there were special guest speakers who would open and close each day with a keynote. Although I was unable to attend all of them, there was still an abundance of words of wisdom and inspiration shared by some amazing women leaders. Here are some empowering thoughts, advice, and quotes from throughout the conference. Will adding more as I go back and watch. 🙌

😏 **Marian Croak** *Chief Troublemaker, VP of Site Reliability Engineering at Google* 
> "I didn't have to be perfect. I didn't have to fit in. All I had to do was what was right for the business."

> "There are times when you're going to want to quit or disengage. Sometimes, you'll hurt so bad that you're going to want to hurt someone. Try to harness that energy and give voice to your concerns. Correct the problem and speak out for yourself."

> "If you want to change things, you have got to be comfortable with being on the edge."

> "Find that one empowering supporter, and everything is going to be okay."

⚽ **Megan Rapinoe** *2x World Cup Champion and Activist* 
> "Women are inherent leaders. We are already doing it."

> "We need to push for diversity and inclusion, not so we can tick off boxes, but to see the bigger picture."

> "The world motto of women is 'Get sh\*t done.' We know how to get stuff done." (Hang's note - please excuse for the language)

🎧 **Mariana Briones** *Co-Founder at InternMakers and Program Manager at Microsoft*
> "Rejection is just a redirection."

🖥️ **Anita Borg** *American computer scientist and founder of the Grace Hopper Celebration*
> "Women transform technology, and technology transforms the world."

## Concluding Thoughts 
As a freshman and a first-timer to the largest gathering of woman technologist, feeling overwhelmed when preparing for the conference was an understatement.

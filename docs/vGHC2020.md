*This year, I was fortunate enough to receive the BRAID ICS Scholarship to attend the Grace Hopper Conference. So, first and foremost, I would like to thank the BRAID Initiative, the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, and WICS for giving me this opportunity.*

There were thousands of women from all over the world coming to the conference for different reasons, whether it was to look for an internship or career, network, or learn more about their field of interest. For me, it was to explore and see what a conference was like. I attended various sessions, workshops, and company booths. Although I did not get to network much or meet one-on-one with any recruiters, I still enjoyed my first Grace Hopper Conference. 

## Sessions
With hundreds of sessions and workshops overall, it was difficult to choose which to attend. In the end, I went for ones that piqued my interest, watching as many as I could with adequate breaks in between. Luckily, the on-demand content makes it easier to go back and watch the many sessions. Here are some of my highlights.

## Words of Wisdom
Throughout the conference, there were special guest speakers who would open and close each day with a keynote. Although I was unable to attend all of them, there was still an abundance of words of wisdoms and inspiration shared by some amazing women leaders. Here are some of empowering thoughts, advice, and quotes. Will adding more as I go back and watch. 🙌

**Marian Croak** *Chief Troublemaker, VP of Site Reliability Engineering at Google* 😏
> "I didn't have to be perfect. I didn't have to fit in. All I had to do was what was right for the business."

> "There are times when you're going to want to quit or disengage. Sometimes, you'll hurt so bad that you're going to want to hurt someone. Try to harness that energy and give voice to your concerns. Correct the problem and speak out for yourself."

> "If you want to change things, you have got to be comfortable with being on the edge."

> "Find that one empowering supporter, and everything is going to be okay."

**Megan Rapinoe** *2x World Cup Champion and Activist* ⚽
> "Women are inherent leaders. We are already doing it."

> "We need to push for diversity and inclusion, not so we can tick off boxes, but to see the bigger picture."

> "The world motto of women is 'Get sh\*t done.' We know how to get stuff done." (Hang's note - please excuse for the language)

## Concluding Thoughts 
As a freshman and a first-timer to the largest gathering of woman technologist, feeling overwhelmed when preparing for the conference was an understatement.
